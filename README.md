# CurFed-CHARM
This is a repository for implementation of "CurFed-CHARM: Curriculum Sequential Federated Learning with a Channel-Hierarchical Action Recognition Model for non-IID Heterogeneous Data in Neuromorphic/Event Cameras"

We will upload the link to the E-FED-Act Dataset and also details of the dataset.

We are currently in process of uploading the dataset. As soon as the uploading and due documentation is done, we will update this repository.
